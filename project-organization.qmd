## Naming Conventions

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES1LTlnpLMk&list=PLy_EwS4oOnoQzWYaWDO_x5t7O1RqHwuhw&index=5&pp=gAQBiAQB >}}

**TL-DR**:

Best practices when naming directories and files:

1.  Make it machine readable
    -   Use globbing to isolate and find files that match a simple pattern using regular expressions in a scripting language
        -   Eg., The following bash code will find all file names that start with `report-2020-` and ends with `.txt` `report-2020-*.txt`
    -   No spaces or accented characters
    -   No punctuation other than hyphens (-) and underscores (\_)
    -   Use lowercase only
2.  Make it human readable
    -   Use highly informative slugs (e.g., `01_collect-cdec-snow-data.R`)
        -   Should be descriptive and should accurately reflect the content
        -   Should be concise
        -   Use plain language, but still readable and understandable
        -   Use hyphenation for spaces
        -   Use underscores to separate metadata that needs to be parsed or processed in a scripting language using regular expressions
        -   Avoid special characters
3.  Sort it in a useful way
    -   Put something numeric first
    -   Logical sorting
        -   Apply left padding (e.g., 01, 02, etc.) to single digit numbers in file names to maintain their sequential order
        -   Use when you have a predefined sequence or steps in a process (e.g., stages in a workflow)
    -   Chronological sorting
        -   Follow the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) standard when formatting dates: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `2020-12-01_draft.docx`)
        -   Use when the timeline of creation, modification, or relevance is important (e.g., In projects with regular updates or when you need to track progress or changes over time where the most recent date indicates the latest version)

| Type | Naming Convention | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
|      |                   |         |
|      |                   |         |
|      |                   |         |

### Example Project Directory Structure

``` {.python .code-overflow-wrap}
📦/g/path/to/example-project-directory # <1>
 ┣ 📂deliverables # <2>
 ┃ ┗ 📂papers # <3>
 ┣ 📂github-repo # <4>

5.  Organizes documentation and planning materials for meetings and events related to the project.
6.  Archives notes and decisions from project meetings.
7.  Prepares and stores agendas for upcoming meetings to structure discussions.

### Create New Project Directory

The following code creates a directory for your project within the `current-projects/` directory in the `Oleson Lab/` Shared Google Drive by making a copy of an existing template.

To execute this code chunk, please do the following:

1.  Ensure you have [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) software downloaded, you are signed in, and are able to see the `Oleson Lab/` directory in your `Shared Drives/` directory
2.  Change `#| eval: false` to `#| eval: true`
3.  Input your desired project name in the code `project_name="example-project"`.

```{bash}
#| label: create-new-project-directory
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| eval: false # <1>
#| echo: fenced

echo "Starting script..." # <2>

cd "/g/Shared drives/Oleson Lab/projects/project-management-resources" # <3>

new_project_template="/g/Shared drives/Oleson Lab/projects/project-management-resources/new-project-template" # <4>

project_name="example-project" # <4>

new_current_project_directory="/g/Shared drives/Oleson Lab/projects/current-projects/$project_name"  # <5>

# Check if the directory already exists
if [ -d "$new_current_project_directory" ]; then # <6>
    echo "Error: A project with the name '$project_name' already exists. Please choose a different name." # <6>
    exit 1 # <6>
fi # <6>

# Copy the new-project-template directory to the new project directory
cp -r "$new_project_template" "$new_current_project_directory" # <7>

echo "Completed copying." # <8>
```

1.  **To run code chunk, set `false` to `true`.**
2.  Confirms that the script is initiated.
3.  Navigates to directory containing the new project template.
4.  Defines a variable `new_project_template` which stores the `new-project-template/` directory file path.
5.  Sets project_name to desired project name and constructs a path for the new project in the `current-projects` directory. **Replace `[insert-project-name]`.**
6.  Checks to see whether or not the directory exists within the `current-projects/` directory and if so, prompts you to choose another name.
7.  Copies everything within the `new-project-template/`directory into the `current-projects/` directory and renames it accordingly.
8.  Confirms that the script ran successfully.
